# DBMS-Project-Online-shopping-management-system
People in large number are doing online shopping today, and it is not only because it is 
convenient as one can shop from home, but also because there is an ample number of 
varieties available, with a high competition of prices.
Here, in this project, customer adds products to cart ; the cart has products ; then 
customer orders from cart ; followed by making payment using different modes of 
payment.
The customer, cart, order, payment and various other details are stored in database using 
Relational Database Management System, MySQL.
Using the database , we can do System Analysis which also includes recommending 
system improvements needed, based on the same data
